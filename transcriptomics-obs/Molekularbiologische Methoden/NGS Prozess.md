Even though a variety of NGS technologies exist, the general steps to sequence DNA (and therefore reverse transcribed RNA) are largely the same. The differences lie primarily in the chemistry of the respective sequencing technologies.

1. **Sample and library preparation**: As a first step, a so-called library is prepared by fragmenting the DNA samples and ligating them with adapter molecules. They act in the hybridisation of the library fragments to the matrix and provide a priming site.
    
2. **Amplification and sequencing**: In the second step, the library gets converted into single strand molecules. During an amplification step (such as a polymerase chain reaction), clusters of DNA molecules are being created. All of the clusters perform individual reactions during a single sequencing run.
    
3. **Data output and analysis**: The output of a sequencing experiment depends on the sequencing technology and chemistry. Some sequencers generate fluorescence signals which are stored in specific output files, and others may generate electric signals which are stored in corresponding file formats. Generally, the amount of generated data, the raw data, is very large. Such data requires complex and computationally heavy processing. This is further discussed in the raw data processing chapter.


RNA-Seq largely follows the DNA sequencing protocols, but includes a reverse transcription step where complementary DNA (cDNA) is synthesized from the RNA template.
