Pyrosequencing measures luminescence that is generated by pyrophosphate synthesis during sequencing.
This process is also commonly known as “sequencing-by-synthesis”

Two years later, Shankar Balasubramanian and David Klenerman, developed and adapted the sequencing-by-synthesis process for a new method which utilizes fluorescent dyes at the company Solexa.
> Solexa’s technology also forms the basis of [[Illumina’s sequencers]], which dominate the market today

he Roche 454 sequencer developed in 2005, was the first sequencer to fully automate the pyrosequencing process in a single, automated machine.
