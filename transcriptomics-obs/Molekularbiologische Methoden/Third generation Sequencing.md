brought two innovations to the market:
> **Long Read Sequencing**: which describes the ability to obtain nucleotide fragments of longer lengths than the usual Illumina short-read sequencers generate (order of 75 to 300 base pairs depending on the sequencer)
>**the ability to sequence in real time**.


Zwei bekannte Vertreter der Dritten Generation:
- Pacific Biosciences ([[PacBio]]) seit 2010.
- [[Oxford Nanopore]] Technologies introduced the GridION in 2012


Strengths:

- Long reads will allow for the assembly of large novel genomes.
    
- Sequencers are portable, allowing for field work.
    
- Possibility to directly detect epigenetic modifications of DNA and RNA sequences.
    
- Speed. Third generation sequencers are fast.
    

Limitations:

- Some third generation sequencers exhibit higher error rates than second generation sequencers.
    
- The reagents are generally more expensive than second generation sequencing.
