The GridION and its successors MinION and Flongle are portable sequencers for DNA and RNA sequencing which produce reads of more than **2 Mb**.

Oxford Nanopore sequencers observe changes in the electrical current that occur when nucleic acids pass through protein nanopores, to identify the nucleotide sequence
