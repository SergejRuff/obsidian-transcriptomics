in 1996, Mostafa Ronaghi, Mathias Uhlen, and Pȧl Nyŕen introduced a new DNA sequencing technique called [[pyrosequencing]], introducing the age of second generation sequencing.

Second generation sequencing, also known as next-generation sequencing (NGS)

 was primarily made possible by further automation in the lab, the usage of computers, and the miniaturization of reactions.


populärste Methode der zweiten Generation: [[Illumina’s sequencers]]

Strengths:

- Second generation sequencing is often the cheapest option with respect to required chemicals.
    
- Sparse material can still be used as input.
    
- High sensitivity to detect low-frequency variants and comprehensive genome coverage.
    
- High capacity with sample multiplexing.
    
- Ability to sequence thousands of genes simultaneously,
    

Limitations:

- The sequencing machines are expensive and often need to be shared with colleagues.
    
- Second generation sequencers are big, stationary machines and not designed for field work.
    
- Generally, second generation sequencing results in many short sequencing fragments (reads) which are hard to use for novel genomes.
    
- The quality of sequencing result is dependent on the reference genome
