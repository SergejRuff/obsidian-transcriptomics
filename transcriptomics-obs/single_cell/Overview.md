Sequencing of RNA can be mainly conducted in two ways: Either by sequencing the mixed RNA from the source of interest across cells (bulk sequencing) or by sequencing the transcriptomes of the cells individually (single-cell sequencing).
> Bulk ist billiger und einfacher.
> Bulk RNA-Seq results in cell-averaged expression profiles, which are generally easier to analyze


# Gemeinsamkeiten und Unterschiede von scRNAseq in Vergleich zu Bulk

A single-cell experiment generally speaking, follows the same steps as a bulk RNA-Seq experiment (see above), but requires several adaptations. Just like bulk sequencing, single-cell sequencing requires lysis, reverse transcription, amplification, and the eventual sequencing.
In addition, single-cell sequencing requires cell isolation and a physical separation into smaller reaction chambers or another form of cell labeling to be able to map the obtained transcriptomes back to the cells of origin later on.

Hence, these are also the steps where most single-cell assays differ: single-cell isolation, transcript amplification, and, depending on the sequencing machine, sequencing.
