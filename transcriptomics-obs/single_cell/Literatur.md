Current best practices in single-cell RNA-seq analysis: a tutorial is a paper written by Malte Lücken and Fabian Theis which introduces best practice single-cell RNA-Seq analysis. The unique contribution of the paper to the field is that it not only serves as a review of the possible analysis steps, but always suggests best practices based on independent benchmarks.Moreover, similarly to the Bioconductor OSCA paper and book, Lücken and Theis do not cover more recent topics such as RNA velocity, spatial transcriptomics or multi-omics. We strongly recommend the paper as an introduction and overview to the field and initial analysis best-practice recommendations.
