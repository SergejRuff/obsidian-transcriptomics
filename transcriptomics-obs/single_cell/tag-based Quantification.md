whereas tag-based protocols only capture the **5’ or 3’ ends**.
Deckt nicht ganze Gen ab ->**keine Splicing Varianten** detektierbar.
making it difficult to unambiguously align reads to a transcript and distinguishing between different isoforms

it allows for the usage of unique molecular identifiers ([[UMI]]s).
+ useful to resolve biases in the transcript amplification process

"One such example is Cap Analysis Gene Expression (CAGE) where the 5’ends of RNA are captured and then sequenced. CAGE allows for the accurate identfication of transcription start sites, which was used to map the promoterome across the entire genome"

the reads **do not need to be adjusted for gene length** since only a single fragment is captured per RNA molecule.
