im Moment drei Arten von Protokollen f√ºr ScRNA-Seq:
- [[plate-based protocols]]
- [[Microfluidic device-based protocols]]
- [[commercial Fluidigm C1 microfluidic chip based solution]] 
- [[ScNaUmi-seq]] 


These three approaches differ in their ability to recover transcripts, the number of sequenced cells, and many other aspects.


In summary, we strongly recommend that wet lab and dry lab scientists select the sequencing protocol based on the aim of the study. Is a deep characterization of a specific cell type population desired? In this case one of the plate-based methods may be more suitable. On the contrary, droplet based assays will capture heterogeneous mixtures better, allowing for a more broad characterization of the sequenced cells. Moreover, if the budget is a limiting factor, the protocol of choice should be more cost-effective and robust. When analyzing the data, be aware of the sequencing assay specific biases.
