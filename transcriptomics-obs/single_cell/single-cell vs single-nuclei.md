Nicht nur Single Cell, auch Single Nuclei möglich.

 Single-cell profiling does not always provide an unbiased view on cell types for specific tissues or organs, such as, for example, the brain.
 During the tissue dissociation process, some cell types are more vulnerable and therefore difficult to capture. For example, fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive interneurons and subcortically projecting glutamatergic neurons were observed in lower proportions than expected in mouse neocortex
 On the contrary, non-neuronal cells survive dissociation better than neurons and are overrepresented in single-cell suspensions in the adult human neocortex


Moreover, **single-cell sequencing highly relies on fresh tissue**, making it difficult to make use of tissue biobanks.
> Single Cell braucht frische Zellen!


nuclei are more resistant to mechanical force, and can be safely isolated from frozen tissue without the use of tissue dissociation enzymes

It has been shown already that nuclei accurately reflect all transcriptional patterns of cells


Data analysis however should be aware of the fact that dissociation ability will have a strong effect on the potentially observable cell types.
