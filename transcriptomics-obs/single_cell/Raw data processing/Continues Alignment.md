# Definition

contiguous alignment seeks a contiguous substring of the reference that aligns well against the read.

# Wann nicht nutzen oder nutzen?

In such alignment problems, though small insertions and deletions may be allowed, large gaps such as those observed in spliced alignments are typically not tolerated.
