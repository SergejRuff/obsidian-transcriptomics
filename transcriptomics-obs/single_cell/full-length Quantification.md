Full-length protocols try to cover the whole transcript uniformly with sequencing reads.
Such techniques which capture the entire RNA are called **full-length methods**

Die Abbildung zeigt Full length in orange. Man sieht, dass die Reads die gesamte RNA/ Transkript abdecken.


 As expected, **longer genes tend to have more reads**. Thus, counts obtained through full-length RNA-seq have to be adjusted for the gene lengths through measures such as **Fragments Per Kilobase per Million reads (FPKM)** or **Transcripts Per kilobase Million (TPM)**.

Full-length sequencing is restricted to [[plate-based protocols]].
 library preparation is comparable to bulk RNA-seq sequencing approaches.

Vorteil:  A major advantage of full-length protocols is that they allow for the detection of splice variants.

Nachteil: even coverage of transcripts is not always achieved with full-length protocols and therefore specific regions across the gene body may still be biased.
